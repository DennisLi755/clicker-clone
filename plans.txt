Songs? Will ask Austin.

Easiest:
    - count every time player hits a beat

Ideal:
    - count every time player hits a 3rd beat

Each song's data need to be tracked
    - BPM
    - Where beat one is (in seconds)

length = 128
bpm = 120
{
    seconds_between_beats = 60/bpm;
    total_duration_of_one_measure = 4 * seconds_between_beats;

    the correct timing would be starting at:
    total_duration_of_one_measure * 0.75 + total_duration_of_one_measure (for each timing afterwards)
}
